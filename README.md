<h1>☢️ Own Your User Folders ☢️</h1>
</br>
<p>Have you ever dreamed of fully own your computer ? Well, Microsoft did, and don't want you to do the same. Here's a script to take back ownership of your files, mainly if you rename a user and want to transfer his files correctly to his new C:\Users\ .</p>
</br>
<h2>⚠️  Before executing it</h2>
</br>
<p>First, you will need to get PsExec, download and extract it where you want, cd through a Powershell Admin panel to the new folder called pstools and type psexec, then finally start the show.</p>
